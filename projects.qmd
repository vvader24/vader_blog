## Functional programming

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
In this project is a tutorial, built using the Distill Website template for functional programming with R. Functions are built for ipsatization of raw data which is a common data type used in personality studies. Raw data is manipulated to minimize any within participant variation by rowwise mean centering or rowwsise scaling methods. The tutorial outlines the importance of this technique and step wise instructions for building functions using `purrr` and `tidyverse` packages.[Continue reading](https://shijing-z.github.io/EDLD653-Final-Project/posts/2021-05-28-write-a-function/)
