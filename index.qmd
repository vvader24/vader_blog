Hi! I am a PhD student in Personality Psychology. I use AI/ML to model cultural differences using personality and values as latent variables. I build culturally sensitive models that avoid researcher biases, in order to understand universal vs. culture-specific ways in which people think, feel and act.I am curious about psychological patterns that emerge across cultural landscapes.
